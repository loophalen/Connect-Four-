# Minimalist Connect Four 

Minimalist Connect Four is a two player connect four game that seeks to create an intuitive user experience while hiding
the game grid within the page. The game was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. 

How To Play: connect four discs of the same color either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. 

Unsolved problems: Not optimized for mobile devices. Would like to add an AI so that the user could play against the comptuer.
